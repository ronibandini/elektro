Elektro robot for Nerdearla 2025

# info
Elektro was a humanoid robot built by Westinghouse in 1937 to showcase a future where automatons would take care of household chores. For those who follow the history of robotics, he’s fascinating—not just for his imposing size, but for his steel bodywork that feels closer to craftsmanship than mass production, and for the quirky extravagances hidden in his functions.
