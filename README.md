Elektro robot for Nerdearla 2025

# info
Elektro was a humanoid robot built by Westinghouse in 1937 to showcase a future where automatons would take care of household chores. For those who follow the history of robotics, he’s fascinating—not just for his imposing size, but for his steel bodywork that feels closer to craftsmanship than mass production, and for the quirky extravagances hidden in his functions.

The first step was getting metals—lots of metals. We used 25-liter air compressors for the feet, cooling tanks, fridge drums for the hands, sheet-metal curtain rods, shock absorbers for the joints, bearings, and parts from household appliances like stoves and washing machines. These pieces were cut and welded using MIG and electric welders, then polished with flap discs.

The body work was carried out by Mauro de Giuseppe with the help of his students from EPS School No. 1 in General Las Heras. This school trains students in trades, providing young people in vulnerable situations with practical skills and tools for the workforce
